		</h1>
    
	  <p> February <br>
<ul>
  <li> I implemented eye tracking in the project with the calibration page</li>
</ul>
	  <p> March <br>
<ul>
 <li> I implemented new meeting with automatically given agora token. When user creates a new meeting, the backend will generate token and channel id automatically (Agora SDK features are used).</li>
  <li> I implemented copy invitation link for people to share with each other to join meeting (front-end + back-end).</li>
  <li> I implemented join meeting in front-end, back-end and Agora SDK (User can join different meeting channels now.) </li>
   
</ul>
	  <p> April <br>
<ul>
  <li> I implemented sending an auto-generated email to the UThere organization email address when a contact form is submitted.</li>
    <li> I implemented asking the user whether you want to leave the meeting via pop-up in front-end.</li>
     <li> I implemented asking the user whether you want to leave the meeting via pop-up in front-end.</li>
     <li> I implemented an instruction pop-up for the calibration process in front-end.</li>
     <li>I implemented presenter can alert people in the meeting page (front end + backend)</li>
      <li>Bilgehan and I implemented the screenshare feature (front-end + Agora SDK)</li>
      <li> I implemented leave the meeting feature (front end+back end)</li>
      <li> Melike implemented send videos from front end to the back end and we all tested in our computers</li>
</ul>
	  <p> May <br>
<ul>
  <li> I implemented assigning the roles to the users in the meeting: host,presenter,participant </li>
  <li> I implemented only presenter can screenshare </li>
  <li> Bilgehan and I move local database to the Google cloud</li>
  <li> New datefield is found for the database (old one only hold for the day-month-year)</li>
  <li> Detail: Sign out will be handled when pressing the icon in addition to the "Sign out" label</li>
  <li> Copy meeting id will only belongs to the host now</li>
  <li> I implemented see who left the meeting in the meeting page (according to the settings + only presenter can see it)(Notification design belongs to Bilgehan + he made a correction of this feature later)</li>
  <li> I implemented the showing attention and emotion info in the database. (Writing it to database belongs to Melike and css-design of the attention/emotion component in the front end belongs to Bilgehan) </li>
  <li> I implemented these settings: "hide real time emotion anaylsis", "hide real time attention analysis", "hide real time analysis" (frount-end+back-end). When user choose to hide them they do not see the related real-time analysis in their meeting page if they are the presenter.</li>
  <li>I implemented this: Attention limit can be changed and if the attention score is below the attention limit that I set in the meeting when I am presenter, the warning popup occurs in the meeting page of the presenter (frontend+backend)</li>
    <li>I implemented all things related to the end-of-meeting analaysis report (creation + showing the page of the user+ sharing with others for the host (Bilgehan designed the end-of-meeting page))</li>
  
</ul>
